# amiga-simple3d

When I was a child, I played the game Elite on my C64 for countless hours. As a teenager I wanted to create something similar on my Amiga.

This is the project I used to learn the basics of 3d graphics and rotation / projection.

It uses fixed point math and a neat look up table for the sinus/cosinus calculations and runs at 50FPS even on a standard A500/A2000.

And here it is all the wireframe glory of 1989! Of course I updated this later on and added hidden surface removal and filled and shaded polygons which will follow in a differend repository.
