# amiga-simple3d
This is the project I used to learn the basics of 3d graphics and rotation / projection. 
It uses fixed point math and a neat look up table for the sinus/cosinus calculations. 
All the wireframe glory of 1989! Of course I updated this later on with hidden line removal and filled shaded polygons which will follow in a differend repository.
